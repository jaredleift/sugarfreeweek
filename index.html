<h1>A sweet obsession</h1>

  <p>It’s Sunday afternoon and you’re off to meet your in-laws for the first time. But fate doesn’t want you to. Your car’s decided to go on strike down a winding country lane and your phone battery’s joined in. No worries, you’ve got one of those portable charger gadgets – but you’ve lent it to your techno-curious mum.</p> <p>Science says that in these moments of stress and preoccupation, it’s normal to seek comfort through a sugary snack. That’s because sugar releases the mood-boosting, 'happy hormone', dopamine into the blood stream. You know that pleasant feeling, we often relate to a sugar rush? That’s the one. Unfortunately for us, though, that rush only masks the beginning of a troublesome process known as the perceptual sugar cycle.  </p>

<p>These addictive properties, combined with the fact our bodies can’t tell when we've had enough of certain types of sugar, can cause people to binge on sugary products. Research has shown that such dietary habits can cause devastating effects on our bodies. </p>

<p>Doctor Lustig, professor of clinical paediatrics at the University of California, affirms that, “sugar consumption contributes to tooth decay, diabetes and heart disease”.  He also suggests a large proportion of us are unaware we may even have diabetes. "Seven-eighths of people with diabetes don’t even know they have it. We are blind to diabetes until we become blind from diabetes."</p>
<p> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/470179/Sugar_reduction_The_evidence_for_action.pdf">The NHS Report</a> promoting a sugar tax, from 2015, states that almost 25% of adults, 10% of 4 to 5 year olds and 19% of 10 to 11 year olds in England are obese, with significant numbers also overweight. Treating obesity and its consequences currently costs the NHS £5.1bn every year and over-consumption of sugar-laden products is regarded a principal cause of this. </p>
<p>Such bad press has contributed to the emergence of a sugar-free culture. Books are being published with sugar-free recipes as people try to cut it from their diet completely. But is it <i>that </i> easy to just quit sugar? Well, I thought I’d give it a go, but not first without seeking advice from a couple of people who have already tried. </p>

<h2>A sugar free week- the finer details</h2>

<p>
I’ve decided to commit to a sugar free week. Firstly, it’s important to differentiate between <b> ‘added sugars’</b>, <b> ‘natural sugars’ </b>and <b>‘total sugars’ </b>. ‘Added sugars’ or ‘free sugars’ are usually found in processed foods such as ready meals, cakes and fizzy drinks, but also in alcohol and ‘healthier’ foods such as some yoghurts and juices. These are the ones getting the bad press. They also include many sweeteners we’d add ourselves at home such as table sugar, jams and honey. ‘Natural sugars’, believe it or not, are those that occur naturally in products such as fresh fruit and milk. During this week, I can consume this type of sugar.  </p>
<blockquote class="left">
<i> "Things like cakes, fizzy drinks and alcohol are getting the bad press." </i>
</blockquote>

Finally, ‘total sugars’ is the sugar value we see on food labels. Those labels do not distinguish between ‘added’ and ‘natural’ sugars. Given that I have to avoid all added sugars, I’ll be cooking from fresh, daily. I’ve made a diet plan which you can view below, but for now, shall we see how it went? Scroll down to watch my video diary.

  <h2>So, can we live without sugar?
</h2>

  <p>We do <i>need</i> sugar. When we eat, the simple sugar glucose is absorbed from the intestines into the bloodstream and distributed around the body. This is particularly important for the brain, as it acts as a fuel to billions of neuronal cells. </p>
<p>  Can we live without unnatural, added sugars? Most definitely. For many people, though, that would be blasphemous. Perhaps the key is in striking a balance. Eating with freedom but awareness, and always remembering the seven cube limit. After all, chocolate might help relax us, but it always comes with a crash. </p>

<p> <b> How much do you rely on sugar? Could you give it up forever? </b> </p>
